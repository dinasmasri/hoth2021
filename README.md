# Front End - React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
#### Dina Masri 
#### Includes the React native code I compiled for the interactive Home and Search components of our app, as well as CSS and JSX React Components.

## A Brief Description of the React Code:

In our prototyper, Framer, I implemented code using React Native that integrates our data components to the various scroll and search grids on our UI screen, using a RESTFUL API of our generated data made using Airtable. The code modifies the data components to facilitate integration.
